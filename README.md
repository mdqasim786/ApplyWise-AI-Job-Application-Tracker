ApplyWise 🚀

ApplyWise is a security-first MERN stack job application tracking platform built to help job seekers organize, track, and analyze their job applications through a clean, scalable, and real-world architecture.

The project is designed to reflect production-level workflows, not just UI demos.

🌟 Project Vision

Job hunting often becomes messy and unorganized. ApplyWise solves this by providing a centralized system where users can securely manage job applications, track statuses, and gain insights — all from one platform.

Security, validation, and scalability are treated as core foundations, not add-ons.
