# 🌟 ApplyWise

ApplyWise is a **security-first job application management platform** designed to help job seekers organize, track, and optimize their job hunting process — all from a single, centralized system.

Job hunting often becomes scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and notes. ApplyWise brings structure, clarity, and insight by combining **secure authentication**, **clean UI**, and **scalable backend architecture**.

Security, validation, and scalability are treated as **core foundations**, not afterthoughts.
